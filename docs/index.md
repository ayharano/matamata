# *matamata* documentation

In this project, we use Architecture decision records (ADRs) to register some of the most important decisions.
For more details, please access [joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record GitHub repo](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record).

Such decisions are stored in [architecture/decisions](./architecture/decisions) subdirectory.
